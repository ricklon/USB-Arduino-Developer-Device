USB Arduino based Developer Device
=============================

The project provides a device that allows for a user configuratble Git hub repositoy to be interacted with via a series buttons, 
switche, and many other I/O electronics. This is very similar to the alias process in Unix.

You'll be able to press buttons:

1.  Clone reposity
1.  Goto Project
2.    button: Get Changes
3.    button: Find New
4.    button: Merge New
5.    button: Show Branches
6.    button: Diff
7.    button: Commit
8.    button: Push

In the future yes/no, and enter buttons could be added. Lot's of fun options.


In this example we'll use buttons. In the Arduino sketch please specify the Git repositoy you want.#

Requirements:
You need Git
Arduino 1.0 with Leonardo support enabled.
A ATMEga32u4 breakout board, Teensy, or Arduino Leonardo with the Leonardo bootloader on it.
