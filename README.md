#USB Arduino Developer Device

The project provides a device that allows for a user configuratble Git hub repositoy to be interacted with via a series buttons, 
switche, and many other I/O electronics. This is very similar to the alias process in Unix.

You'll be able to press:
button 1: Clone reposity
button 2: Fetch changes
button 3: Check for differences
button 4: Merge changes
button 5: List all branchs
button 6: Check reposoty status
button 7: commit changes, you'll need to type a message, and hit enter.

In the future yes/no, and enter buttons could be added.


In this example we'll use buttons. In the Arduino sketch please specify the Git repositoy you want.#

Requirements:
You need Git
Arduino 1.0 with Leonardo support enabled.
A ATMEga32u4 breakout board, Teensy, or Arduino Leonardo
